Project Link :
http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html

Sections Of the Project Covered are:

Search:
Utilize depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search methodologies. These approaches are instrumental in addressing navigation and traveling salesman quandaries within the Pacman environment.


Multi-Agent Search:
Within the realm of Classic Pacman, encounter both adversarial and stochastic search conundrums. 

Executed adversarial search algorithms like `Reflex agent`, `Minimax Algorithm`, `Alpha Beta Pruning`, `Expectimax Search` and `Better Evaluation Function` algorithms in the `multiAgents.py` file.
