Sections Of the Project Covered are:

Search:
Utilize depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search methodologies. These approaches are instrumental in addressing navigation and traveling salesman quandaries within the Pacman environment.

Within the realm of Classic Pacman, encounter both adversarial and stochastic search conundrums. Execute multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, alongside crafting evaluation criteria.
